# Jugend Forscht 202021

This Project is for the german "Jugend Forscht" competition in which young people
should do some science-experiments/projects. I've decided to work with IT/math and do something
related to this.

For german people reading this: This repository is (mostly) in english as it should be
accessible by not-only-germans.
